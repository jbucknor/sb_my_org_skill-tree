# Development Instructions: Life Skills Gamification - Personal Skill Tree

## Project Summary
Develop an interactive web-based application that transforms personal development into an engaging, game-like experience by visualizing life skills as an interconnected skill tree similar to Path of Exile's passive skill system. The platform targets individuals seeking to gamify their personal growth across seven life domains: Family, Business, Relationships, Health, Finances, Spirituality, and Emotions. Users can track achievements, earn skill points, and visualize their progress through an interconnected node system, deployed as a static site on GitHub Pages.

## Implementation Guidelines

### Architecture & Design

#### Frontend Architecture
- **Client-Side Application**: Pure frontend implementation using HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript
- **Canvas-Based Visualization**: HTML5 Canvas API for interactive skill tree rendering with custom node positioning algorithms
- **Progressive Web App**: Service Worker implementation for offline functionality and improved performance
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach supporting desktop, tablet, and mobile devices (320px+ width)

#### Data Architecture
- **JSON-Based Data Model**: Structured skill definitions, user progress, and configuration data
- **Local Storage Persistence**: Browser localStorage for user progress without server dependencies
- **Import/Export System**: JSON file-based save/load functionality for backup and sharing

              ## Key Implementation Notes

              ### Canvas Rendering Considerations
              - **Performance Optimization**: Implement viewport culling to only render visible nodes
              - **High DPI Support**: Scale Canvas for retina displays with proper pixel density
              - **Event Handling**: Convert mouse/touch coordinates to Canvas coordinate system
              - **Memory Management**: Clear Canvas efficiently and avoid memory leaks in animation loops

              ### Skill Tree Algorithm Design
              ```javascript
              // Example skill node data structure
              {
                "skill_id": "family_communication_001",
                  "name": "Active Listening",
                    "description": "Practice focused listening with family members",
                      "category": "family",
                        "points": 3,
                          "timeRequired": "15 hours",
                            "prerequisites": [],
                              "unlocks": ["family_communication_002", "relationships_empathy_001"],
                                "position": { "x": 250, "y": 150 },
                                  "icon": "ear-icon.svg",
                                    "achievements": [
                                        "Listen without interrupting in 5 family conversations",
                                            "Ask clarifying questions instead of making assumptions",
                                                "Summarize what you heard before responding"
                                                  ]
                                                  }
                                                  ```

                                                  ### Local Storage Implementation
                                                  - **Data Versioning**: Implement schema versioning for future updates

                                                  - **Migration Support**: Handle data format changes gracefully

                                                  ### Performance Optimization Strategies
                                                  - **Lazy Loading**: Load skill data progressively as users explore different areas
                                                  - **Caching**: Cache rendered Canvas elements for frequently viewed areas
                                                  - **Debounced Interactions**: Optimize mouse/touch event handlers to prevent performance issues
                                                  - **Progressive Enhancement**: Basic functionality without JavaScript for accessibility

                                                  ### GitHub Pages Constraints & Solutions
                                                  - **Static Content Only**: All logic must be client-side JavaScript
                                                  - **File Size Limits**: Optimize images and data files for web delivery
                                                  - **Custom Domain**: Support for optional custom domain configuration
                                                  - **SEO Optimization**: Proper meta tags and structured data for discoverability

                                                  ### Accessibility Implementation
                                                  - **Screen Reader Support**: ARIA labels and descriptions for all interactive Canvas elements
                                                  - **Keyboard Navigation**: Full skill tree navigation using arrow keys and shortcuts
                                                  - **Focus Management**: Clear focus indicators and logical tab order
                                                  - **Alternative Text**: Descriptive text for all visual skill information
                                                  - **Color Independence**: Information conveyed through multiple visual cues, not just color
